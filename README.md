# Community-message-board-website
It is a simple community message board where we can add a message to anyone or a group of people.
it is made with CRUD operations in python using the Flask and Flask SQLchemy module.
I have also used html and css.
some prebuilt css from bootstrap has been used in this project.

# Key features:
1) create chat: in this functionality you can create a chat not literally a chat like whatsapp but its a way simpler one where message is presented as a card which includes the following details:
              i) name of sender
              ii) message
              iii) name of reciever

2) update/edit chat: with this functionality you can edit the chats you created. by clickiing on the edit button on a chat, you'll be redirected to a edit page where you'll get a form to edit this chat.

3) delete chat: with this functionality you can delete aa chat but beware it'll be deleted permanantly from the database and cannot be reverted back.
